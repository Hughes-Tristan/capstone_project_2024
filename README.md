Steps for Commiting: <br />

- Always create and make sure you are working in your own branch!<br />
- When you are finished working during a single session make sure you save changes by commiting and pushing to your own branch. <br />
- You can submit a pull request after doing that and make sure to add reviewers.<br />
- Once a pull request is accepted and it is merged with the master your branch might now be outdated.<br />
- Switch to master branch and click pull origin.<br />
- You can now create a brand new branch, otherwise if you are currently working on a feature then switch back to the branch you are working in. <br />
- IMPORTANT: Make sure you have commited and pushed to your own branch before updating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
- Once you have double checked your branch is commited and pushed you can now update using the menu in the top right. Locate branch, then click update from master. <br />
